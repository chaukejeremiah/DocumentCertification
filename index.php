    <h2>Welcome to the Document Certification System</h2>
    <p>This platform helps South Africans certify documents using facial recognition and data verification against government databases, providing a secure and efficient way to ensure authenticity.</p>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>To begin using the Document Certification System, users must upload a scanned document, a selfie for face verification, and other required details. The platform then checks the submitted information against government databases for verification. Upon successful verification, a certified document will be made available for download.</p>
        <p>This system provides a fast and reliable way to certify documents, eliminating the need for physical visits to government offices.</p>
